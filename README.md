## Jumble Solver:
-The jumble puzzle is a common newspaper puzzle, it contains a series of anagrams that must be solved  
(see -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumble). To solve, one must solve each of the individual jumbles. The circled letters are  then -used to create an additional anagram to be solved. In especially difficult versions, some of the anagrams in the first  set can possess multiple solutions. To get the final answer, it is important to know all possible anagrams of a given series of  letters.
